As AI models transition from development into production, maintaining their performance and reliability becomes a critical challenge. Real-time model monitoring is essential to detect issues such as data drift, concept drift, and inference anomalies before they impact business outcomes. In 2025, combining Prometheus and OpenTelemetry offers a powerful observability stack tailored for MLOps teams to monitor, alert, and troubleshoot production AI systems effectively.

Prometheus, a widely adopted open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, excels at collecting and querying time-series metrics. Its flexible data model and powerful query language (PromQL) enable teams to instrument model serving endpoints, track latency, throughput, error rates, and resource consumption with precision. Prometheus also integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes, which is a common platform for deploying AI inference workloads.

OpenTelemetry complements Prometheus by providing a unified framework to collect distributed traces, logs, and metrics from AI pipelines. Tracing model inference requests across microservices helps teams understand bottlenecks, latency spikes, or failures within complex workflows. OpenTelemetry’s vendor-neutral APIs ensure observability data can flow into multiple backends, enabling flexibility in tooling choices.

Together, Prometheus and OpenTelemetry enable a holistic view of AI model health. MLOps engineers can define SLIs (Service Level Indicators) and SLOs (Service Level Objectives) that reflect model accuracy, prediction confidence, and data input quality. When metrics breach thresholds, Prometheus alerts trigger notifications that feed into incident management workflows, ensuring rapid response.

A key advantage of this observability stack is its scalability. Prometheus’ pull-based model works efficiently in large Kubernetes clusters, while OpenTelemetry agents deployed alongside model servers provide granular telemetry without impacting performance. This balance ensures that monitoring overhead stays low, even as model complexity and request volumes grow.

Implementing real-time model monitoring also means capturing domain-specific metrics. For example, fraud detection models may track the number of flagged transactions per minute, while recommendation systems might monitor user engagement metrics correlated with model outputs. Custom instrumentation enables teams to tailor observability to business KPIs and use cases.

Security and compliance considerations are embedded into the monitoring design. Observability data is sensitive, often containing PII or intellectual property. Encrypting telemetry in transit, controlling access to monitoring dashboards, and anonymizing data where possible protect against leakage and misuse.

Organizations adopting this monitoring approach often embed it into their CI/CD pipelines, using automated tests that validate not just model accuracy but also performance and observability coverage before deployment. This practice ensures that models entering production meet stringent reliability standards.

In conclusion, real-time model monitoring powered by Prometheus and OpenTelemetry represents a best-practice observability framework for production AI systems in 2025. It empowers MLOps teams to maintain model trustworthiness, optimize performance, and swiftly react to anomalies—helping businesses get the most value from their AI investments in a rapidly evolving landscape.
