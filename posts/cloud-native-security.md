#### What is Cloud-Native Security?

Cloud-native security refers to protecting applications and infrastructure built using cloud-native technologies like containers, serverless, service meshes, and orchestration tools such as Kubernetes. It requires dynamic, automated, and scalable security practices that align with DevOps workflows.
