# Docker for DevOps: Practical Examples Beyond Hello World

Docker has become a cornerstone of modern DevOps workflows. It enables teams to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that run consistently across environments. But beyond the classic “Hello World” demos, what does real-world Docker usage look like for DevOps engineers?

In this post, we’ll explore **practical Docker examples** used in DevOps—from local development and testing, to CI/CD pipelines and production deployments.

## Why Docker Matters in DevOps

In DevOps, speed, reliability, and consistency are non-negotiable. Docker addresses all three:

- **Consistency**: Run the same container image in dev, test, and production
- **Speed**: Containers are fast to build, start, stop, and scale
- **Portability**: Works across platforms and cloud providers
- **Isolation**: Prevent conflicts between application environments

## Real-World Docker Use Cases in DevOps

### 1. Local Development Environments

DevOps teams use Docker Compose to spin up local environments that mirror production.

**Example**:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: dev
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
