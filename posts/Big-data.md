## What Is Big Data?

Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that traditional data processing tools cannot manage efficiently. It involves:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Capturing</strong> large volumes of structured and unstructured data</li>
  <li><strong>Storing</strong> it securely and efficiently</li>
  <li><strong>Processing</strong> data at scale</li>
  <li><strong>Analyzing</strong> it to uncover patterns, trends, and insights</li>
</ul>

These insights support data-driven decision-making across industries.
