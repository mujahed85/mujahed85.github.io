Platform Engineering is emerging as a key discipline within modern software delivery, focused on building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that streamline infrastructure, deployments, and tooling. It enables developers to ship software faster and safer without being blocked by complex backend systems.

#### What is Platform Engineering?

Platform Engineering is the practice of designing and maintaining a shared platform—an Internal Developer Platform (IDP)—that abstracts away the operational complexities of cloud environments. These platforms provide self-service tools, guardrails, and automation for developers, making it easier to build, test, and deploy applications.
