# Fine-Tuning GPT Models with OpenAI API – A Beginner's Tutorial

Fine-tuning is one of the most powerful (and underrated) ways to customize GPT models for your specific use case.

When I first started using the OpenAI API, I used the base models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `davinci`, but I quickly realized they were too general for some tasks.

That’s when I started learning about fine-tuning.

In this post, I’ll walk through how I fine-tuned a GPT model from scratch — step-by-step — using my own dataset and the OpenAI CLI.

## Why Fine-Tune a GPT Model?

Out-of-the-box GPT models are powerful, but sometimes you want more control over:

- Specific tone or formatting  
- Domain-specific vocabulary  
- Repeated instructions without re-prompting  
- Structured outputs for applications like chatbots, analysis tools, or summarizers  

Fine-tuning helps the model learn from your data and replicate exactly the behavior you need.

## My Use Case

I had a collection of customer support transcripts and wanted to build a model that could mimic our best agents' responses.

Instead of writing complex prompts every time, I decided to fine-tune a model that already “knew” how to respond in our style.

## Step 1: Preparing the Dataset

Fine-tuning with OpenAI requires a very specific format — JSONL.

Each line contains a prompt and a completion.

Example:

```json
{"prompt": "Customer: I forgot my password.\nAgent:", "completion": " No worries! Let me help you reset it. Please click on the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page."}
