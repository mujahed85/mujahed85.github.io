# Fine-Tuning GPT Models with OpenAI API – A Beginner's Tutorial

Fine-tuning is one of the most powerful (and underrated) ways to customize GPT models for your specific use case.

When I first started using the OpenAI API, I worked with the base models like `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `davinci`. They were great, but sometimes too general.

That’s when I started learning about fine-tuning.

In this post, I’ll walk you through how I fine-tuned a GPT model from scratch using my own dataset and the OpenAI CLI.

## Why Fine-Tune a GPT Model?

Out-of-the-box GPT models are powerful, but sometimes you want more control over:

- Specific tone or formatting  
- Domain-specific vocabulary  
- Repeated instructions without re-prompting  
- Structured outputs for chatbots, summarizers, or decision tools  

Fine-tuning helps the model learn from your data and replicate the behavior you want — consistently and efficiently.

## My Use Case

I had a dataset of customer support transcripts and wanted to build a model that could mimic our top agents' responses.

Instead of engineering complex prompts every time, I fine-tuned a model to respond in our brand voice and handle recurring support issues accurately.

## Step 1: Preparing the Dataset

Fine-tuning with OpenAI requires data in **JSONL (JSON Lines)** format. Each line represents a training example with two keys:

- `prompt`: The input or question  
- `completion`: The model’s expected output  

### Example:

```json
{"prompt": "Customer: I forgot my password.\nAgent:", "completion": " No worries! Let me help you reset it. Please click on the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page."}
Guidelines:
Use \n for new lines within prompts

Add a space before the completion text

Ensure completions end with a stop word if needed (e.g., ###)

Keep responses short and relevant

Step 2: Formatting and Cleaning
I created a Python script to convert my raw data (CSV) into clean JSONL.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import json

df = pd.read_csv("transcripts.csv")

with open("fine_tune_data.jsonl", "w") as f:
    for i, row in df.iterrows():
        prompt = f"Customer: {row['customer_message']}\nAgent:"
        completion = " " + row['agent_reply']
        json_line = {"prompt": prompt, "completion": completion}
        f.write(json.dumps(json_line) + "\n")
Then I validated the file using the OpenAI CLI.

bash
Copy code
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f fine_tune_data.jsonl
Step 3: Uploading and Starting the Fine-Tune
After preparing the file, I uploaded the dataset and started the fine-tuning job.

bash
Copy code
openai api fine_tunes.create -t "fine_tune_data_prepared.jsonl" -m "davinci-002"
Here:

-t is the path to the training file

-m is the base model to fine-tune (e.g., davinci-002, babbage-002, etc.)

The CLI outputs a job ID and status. You can check the progress:

bash
Copy code
openai api fine_tunes.follow -i <JOB_ID>
Step 4: Using the Fine-Tuned Model
Once complete, you’ll get a model name like davinci:ft-your-org-2025-09-24-10-00-00.

Now, you can use this model like any other:

bash
Copy code
openai api completions.create -m "davinci:ft-your-org-..." -p "Customer: How do I change my email?\nAgent:"
Or through the Python SDK:

python
Copy code
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

response = openai.Completion.create(
  model="davinci:ft-your-org-...",
  prompt="Customer: How do I change my email?\nAgent:",
  temperature=0.5,
  max_tokens=100
)

print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
Step 5: Testing and Iterating
Fine-tuning is an iterative process. After deployment, I:

Ran sample prompts

Logged results

Identified weak outputs

Adjusted training examples

Re-trained when necessary

It often takes a few iterations to get the model behavior just right.

Tools Used
OpenAI CLI – to upload data and trigger fine-tuning

Python – for data processing

pandas – for dataset manipulation

Jupyter Notebooks – for prototyping and testing

Scikit-learn (optional) – for stratifying data before splitting

Pros and Cons of Fine-Tuning
Pros
Custom behavior without prompt engineering

Domain-specific knowledge baked into model

Consistent and repeatable outputs

Great for support bots, writing tools, summarizers, and more

Cons
Requires clean and structured data

Costs more than using base models

Limited control over complex logic (vs embedding + retrieval-based methods)

Not always better than using function-calling or RAG approaches

Key Considerations Before You Start
Use fine-tuning only if you need consistent custom behavior

Consider embedding + retrieval for broader knowledge access

Start small — even 50-100 examples can drastically improve outputs

Keep token cost in mind when choosing the base model

Use eval sets to track model performance over time

What’s Next?
Now that I’ve built my first fine-tuned GPT model, here’s where I want to go:

Add more examples and perform batch fine-tuning

Use babbage-002 for cheaper, faster responses in production

Build a UI with Streamlit or React to test outputs

Combine RAG + fine-tuning for hybrid performance

Automate re-training using versioned datasets and performance metrics

Final Thoughts
Fine-tuning GPT models is more accessible than ever, and the results are surprisingly powerful when done right.

You don’t need massive datasets or deep ML knowledge — just clean examples and a clear goal.

For anyone building intelligent applications, fine-tuning is a powerful tool worth adding to your workflow.
