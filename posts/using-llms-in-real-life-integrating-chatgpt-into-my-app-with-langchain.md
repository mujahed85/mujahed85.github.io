# Using LLMs in Real Life: Integrating ChatGPT into My App with LangChain

I’d been experimenting with GPT models for months — testing prompts, playing with the OpenAI playground, building chatbots for fun.

But things changed when I decided to use it **in a real application**.  

The goal? Add an AI assistant into a web app I was building — something that could answer domain-specific queries, respond in context, and remember previous questions.

I used **LangChain** to bridge the gap between ChatGPT and my application’s logic. Here's how I made it work, what I struggled with, and what I learned.

## Why LangChain?

LangChain gives structure to building LLM apps.  

Instead of hard-coding prompt pipelines or manually handling state, it offers tools for chaining prompts, injecting context, managing memory, and integrating external data sources.

For me, the killer features were:

- Prompt templates  
- Memory (chat history)  
- Agent tools  
- Integration with OpenAI  

## Step 1: Installing LangChain

I started with a basic Python environment:

```bash
pip install openai langchain
