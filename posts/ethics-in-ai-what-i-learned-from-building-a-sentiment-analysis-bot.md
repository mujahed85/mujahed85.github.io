# Ethics in AI: What I Learned from Building a Sentiment Analysis Bot

When I decided to build a sentiment analysis bot, I was mostly focused on the technical challenges—getting the model to correctly identify positive and negative emotions in text. But as the project progressed, I quickly realized that building AI isn’t just about code or accuracy. It’s about responsibility.

One of the first things I ran into was bias. The dataset I used was collected from social media, and it carried all the biases of its sources. Certain groups’ language was underrepresented or misinterpreted. That made the bot unfairly label some comments as negative when they weren’t. It was a tough reminder that AI models reflect the data they’re trained on—and that data isn’t neutral.

Then there was the issue of transparency. When people started using the bot, they asked how it worked. Could they trust its output? Explaining the complexities of natural language processing to non-technical users was challenging, but important. I learned that providing clear disclaimers and sharing how the model makes decisions helps build trust.

Privacy was another concern. My bot processed real user text, sometimes sensitive or personal. I had to make sure the data was handled securely, anonymized when needed, and never stored longer than necessary. It made me more aware of the ethical implications of data collection and retention.

I also wrestled with the question of misuse. What if someone used the bot to unfairly judge or silence opinions? Building in safeguards, like filtering out harmful language or allowing user feedback, became essential parts of the project. I realized AI tools need to be designed not just for what they can do, but for how they might be misused.

Ultimately, this project made me see AI development as a deeply human endeavor. It’s about understanding the impact our models have on real people and communities, and making choices that respect fairness, privacy, and dignity.

Building the sentiment analysis bot was a technical milestone, but the lessons on ethics will stick with me much longer.
