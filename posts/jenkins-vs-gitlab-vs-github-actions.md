# Jenkins vs GitLab CI vs GitHub Actions: Which One Should You Use?

In the world of modern DevOps, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for fast, reliable software development. Among the most popular tools in this space are **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, and **GitHub Actions**. Each offers powerful automation features, but they differ significantly in terms of setup, flexibility, and integration.

This post compares Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions to help you decide which is best for your project.

## 1. Jenkins

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server that has been around since 2011. It's highly extensible and has a massive plugin ecosystem.

### Pros
- Highly customizable and extendable with plugins
- Large community and long-standing support
- Can be run on any infrastructure

### Cons
- Steeper learning curve
- Requires manual setup and maintenance
- UI can feel outdated

## 2. GitLab CI

**GitLab CI** is a built-in CI/CD solution integrated into the GitLab platform. It requires a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your repository to define pipelines.

### Pros
- Native GitLab integration
- Easy setup with built-in runners
- Clear pipeline visualization

### Cons
- Tied to GitLab repositories
- Less flexibility than Jenkins in complex pipelines

## 3. GitHub Actions

**GitHub Actions** is GitHubâ€™s own CI/CD platform, integrated directly into the GitHub interface. It uses workflow YAML files inside the `.github/workflows/` directory.

### Pros
- Seamless integration with GitHub
- Simple and intuitive syntax
- Large marketplace of pre-built actions

### Cons
- Limited to GitHub-hosted repositories
- Debugging can be more difficult than other platforms

## Which One Should You Use?

- **Choose Jenkins** if you need maximum flexibility, work in a complex environment, or already have infrastructure for it.
- **Choose GitLab CI** if you're using GitLab repositories and want a
