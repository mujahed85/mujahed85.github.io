# From Notebook to Production: Lessons Learned in ML Deployment

When I first started building machine learning models, everything happened in notebooks. I’d experiment with data, try out algorithms, tune hyperparameters, and get excited when the validation accuracy looked good.  

But that excitement quickly faded the moment I had to turn the notebook into something real — something that could run consistently, handle new data, and actually deliver value.

Deploying machine learning models to production is a completely different world from building them in a Jupyter notebook. And it took me a while to really understand that.

The first thing I learned is that your notebook isn’t production code. In a notebook, it’s easy to cut corners — skip error handling, hardcode paths, rely on cached variables, and stack everything in one big script. But once it goes into production, all of that breaks.

The moment I moved my model into an API, I had to start thinking about things like versioning, input validation, concurrency, and logging. None of that was in my notebook. I had to pull the model out, package it cleanly, and serve it through something like FastAPI or Flask.

Another big shift was realizing how important data consistency is. The data I trained on wasn’t always the same as what I got in production. Sometimes columns were missing. Sometimes formats changed. Even small things — like a feature being stored as a string instead of a number — would break the model silently or throw errors.

To handle that, I started writing preprocessing pipelines that ran both during training and inference. Tools like scikit-learn’s `Pipeline` helped, but I eventually had to write custom logic to handle real-world edge cases. And once I deployed it, I had to monitor not just the API itself, but also the distribution of the input data.

Monitoring turned out to be another huge lesson. I initially deployed my first model and just assumed it would work. I didn’t set up alerts. I didn’t log inputs or predictions. And when something went wrong — like suddenly getting empty responses or strange outputs — I had no idea why.

Now I make sure to log everything: inputs, outputs, timestamps, response times. I also add basic performance monitoring to catch drifts and anomalies early. It’s not glamorous work, but it’s the difference between a demo and a dependable system.

Then there’s the issue of reproducibility. In notebooks, it’s easy to lose track of which version of the data or model you used. You run a few cells, tweak a few values, and suddenly you have a model that works — but you don’t know why.

In production, that kind of mystery is dangerous. So I started using version control for data and models. Tools like DVC, MLflow, and Git helped a lot. They gave me the ability to recreate any version of the model and trace exactly how it was trained.

The last big challenge was integration. My model didn’t exist in isolation — it had to interact with other services, databases, APIs, and users. That meant handling errors gracefully, returning meaningful messages, retrying failed jobs, and making sure the entire system was robust.

It took me a while to stop thinking like a data scientist and start thinking like a software engineer. But once I did, everything started falling into place.

The transition from notebook to production isn’t easy. But it’s where the real impact of machine learning happens.
