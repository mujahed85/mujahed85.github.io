# Monitoring and Logging in Cloud Apps: CloudWatch, Prometheus & Beyond

When your applications move to the cloud, monitoring and logging aren’t optional anymore — they’re essential.

Without visibility into what’s happening inside your services, you’re flying blind.

In this post, I’ll walk through how I approached monitoring and logging in my cloud applications using tools like AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, and others.

## Why Monitoring Matters More in the Cloud

In traditional setups, you often had access to the bare metal — logs lived on the servers, and you could SSH in when something went wrong.

With cloud-native architectures, especially distributed or serverless systems, logs are scattered, ephemeral, and short-lived.

Monitoring and observability become your lifeline to understanding system behavior, debugging issues, and improving performance.

## AWS CloudWatch: The Default for AWS Workloads

For my AWS-based apps, CloudWatch was the first tool I used.

It collects logs, metrics, events, and traces from AWS services — without needing to install agents.

I used CloudWatch for:

- Collecting logs from Lambda, ECS, and EC2  
- Creating dashboards to track CPU, memory, and latency  
- Setting up alarms and notifications when things went wrong  
- Tracing requests end-to-end using AWS X-Ray integration  

CloudWatch was easy to set up and great for basic needs, but it gets expensive and harder to manage as your logs grow.

## Prometheus + Grafana: More Control, More Flexibility

For workloads running in Kubernetes, I switched to Prometheus for monitoring.

It’s open-source, powerful, and built for time-series data.

Prometheus scraped metrics from my services, and I visualized everything using Grafana dashboards.

What I liked most:

- Custom metrics from my own services  
- Detailed query language (PromQL)  
- Flexible alerting with Alertmanager  
- Smooth integration with K8s via service discovery  

This setup gave me more control than CloudWatch, especially for custom metrics and real-time monitoring.

## Centralized Logging with Loki & ELK Stack

For logs, I experimented with different solutions.

I used:

- **Loki** (from Grafana Labs) — for Kubernetes logging, integrated well with Grafana  
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) — powerful but resource-heavy  
- **Fluent Bit** — lightweight agent to send logs to external services like S3 or CloudWatch  

Having centralized logging helped me trace issues across microservices and correlate events more easily.

## Key Metrics I Always Track

No matter the tool, these are some of the key metrics I monitor:

- API response times  
- Request rate (RPS)  
- Error rates and 5xx responses  
- CPU and memory usage  
- Queue lengths (e.g., SQS, Pub/Sub)  
- Database query latency and throughput  

Good alerts are specific and actionable — not noisy. It took trial and error to get this right.

## Observability = Monitoring + Logging + Tracing

Eventually, I learned that observability is more than just dashboards and logs.

It’s about being able to answer questions like:

- What’s causing this latency spike?  
- Which service is failing and why?  
- How did this user request travel through the system?

Combining metrics, logs, and traces helps build that picture — and tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry are making that easier every day.

## Final Note

Monitoring and logging aren’t just for production.

I now set them up from the start — in dev and staging too — because the earlier you catch issues, the cheaper they are to fix.

Whether you're using fully managed tools like CloudWatch or building out custom stacks with Prometheus and Grafana, the goal is the same: keep your systems observable, stable, and resilient.
