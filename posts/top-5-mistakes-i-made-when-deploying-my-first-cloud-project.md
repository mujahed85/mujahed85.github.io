# Top 5 Mistakes I Made When Deploying My First Cloud Project

Deploying my first cloud project was an exciting but challenging experience. 

Along the way, I made several mistakes that taught me valuable lessons.

Here are the top five mistakes I made and what I learned from each.

## Mistake 1: Ignoring Cost Management

When I started, I didn’t pay close attention to the pricing models of the cloud services I was using.

I ended up with unexpectedly high bills because of unused resources and over-provisioning.

Lesson learned: Always monitor costs regularly and use budgeting and alert tools provided by cloud platforms.

## Mistake 2: Skipping Proper Security Configurations

In my eagerness to get things running, I neglected proper security settings like configuring firewalls and access permissions.

This left my project vulnerable to unauthorized access.

Lesson learned: Security must be a priority from day one, including setting up IAM roles, policies, and network security.

## Mistake 3: Not Automating Infrastructure

I manually created resources using the cloud console which was slow and error-prone.

Later, I switched to Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform to automate deployments.

Lesson learned: Automation improves consistency, repeatability, and saves time.

## Mistake 4: Overcomplicating Architecture

I tried to build a complex architecture with multiple services before fully understanding their necessity.

This led to confusion and difficulties in troubleshooting.

Lesson learned: Start simple, then iterate and add complexity only when needed.

## Mistake 5: Neglecting Backups and Disaster Recovery

I didn’t set up proper backups or disaster recovery plans initially.

When something went wrong, it caused significant downtime and data loss.

Lesson learned: Always implement backup strategies and test recovery procedures.

Mistakes are part of the learning process, especially in cloud computing.

By recognizing these common pitfalls, you can avoid them and build more robust, secure, and cost-efficient cloud projects.
