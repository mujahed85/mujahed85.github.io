# Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLOv8 and OpenCV – Explained

I always found computer vision fascinating — the idea that a machine can “see” and understand the world around it felt like something out of science fiction. So, when I heard about YOLOv8 and how easy it was to set up real-time object detection, I had to try it myself.

I wasn’t building anything super complex. I just wanted to take a webcam feed, run it through a pre-trained model, and detect things like people, chairs, or phones in real time. It sounded simple enough, but I quickly realized there’s a lot that goes into getting this to work smoothly, especially if you care about speed and accuracy.

I started by installing Ultralytics’ YOLOv8 package — they’ve made it incredibly straightforward. You just run a pip install, and within minutes, you have access to models that are already trained on the COCO dataset.

OpenCV handled the webcam feed. I wrote a few lines of code to open the default camera and read frames in a loop. Every frame was passed into the YOLO model, which returned predictions — class names, confidence scores, and bounding boxes. The results were drawn back onto the frame, and OpenCV displayed the output in a window.

What surprised me was how fast it ran out of the box. I didn’t use a GPU for this test — just a regular laptop CPU — and it still managed a decent frame rate with the smaller YOLOv8n model. For quick prototyping or demos, this was more than enough.

I also noticed that the model was fairly accurate, even in different lighting conditions. I tested it during the day and at night under artificial light, and it was still able to detect people, bottles, laptops, and random household items with impressive consistency. Of course, false positives did happen now and then, but overall it felt solid.

Another cool part was how easy it was to tweak the detection settings. If I wanted to raise the confidence threshold to avoid noisy detections, I could do that with a single argument. If I wanted to switch to a larger model like YOLOv8m or v8l for better accuracy, I just had to change the model name.

I even tried using a video file instead of the webcam. I replaced the camera input with a file path, and the rest of the code stayed the same. Within seconds, it was running detections on each frame of the video, just like it did with live feed. It felt modular and adaptable — like I could plug it into a bigger project without rewriting everything from scratch.

What I liked most was how visual and interactive the whole process felt. Every time the model correctly identified a person or object, it drew a neat little bounding box with a label. Watching it work in real time made the whole concept of computer vision click for me in a way that reading theory never did.

This project didn’t take days to build. It came together in a couple of hours — thanks to how mature these libraries have become. It was one of those rare projects where things actually work the way the documentation says they will.

And even though this started as a small side experiment, it gave me a solid foundation for future ideas. Now I know how to hook up a camera feed, process frames through a deep learning model, and return real-time predictions. Whether I’m building something for robotics, surveillance, or a smart home app — the core building blocks are now in place.
