#### Core Cloud Service Models

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

   * **Overview**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
   * **Examples**: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine.
   * **Benefits**: Flexibility to build custom environments without hardware investment.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

   * **Overview**: Provides platforms for building, testing, and deploying applications.
   * **Examples**: Google App Engine, Heroku, Azure App Services.
   * **Benefits**: Simplifies development by managing underlying infrastructure.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

   * **Overview**: Delivers ready-to-use applications over the internet.
   * **Examples**: Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Dropbox.
   * **Benefits**: Accessible from anywhere, reduces need for software maintenance.

#### Implementing Cloud: Best Practices

1. **Assess Workloads**

   * Determine which applications and data are best suited for the cloud.

2. **Choose the Right Cloud Model**

   * Public, private, or hybrid clouds depending on security and control needs.

3. **Ensure Security and Compliance**

   * Implement encryption, identity management, and regular audits.

4. **Optimize Costs**

   * Monitor usage and leverage reserved instances or spot pricing.

5. **Train Teams**

   * Equip staff with cloud skills to manage and innovate effectively.
