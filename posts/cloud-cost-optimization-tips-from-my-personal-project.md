# Cloud Cost Optimization Tips from My Personal Project

When I first moved my personal project to the cloud, I didn’t think much about cost.

It wasn’t until I got a surprisingly high bill that I realized how easy it is to overspend without even noticing.

Since then, I’ve learned a lot about optimizing cloud costs through real usage, not theory.

Here are the lessons I picked up while trying to keep my project fast, functional — and affordable.

## 1. Monitor Everything from Day One

One of my early mistakes was not setting up billing alerts.

I assumed my usage was too small to worry about.

Now, I track my spending daily with AWS Budgets and GCP’s cost breakdown dashboards.

Small services add up fast — even idle ones.

Monitoring usage and costs helps me catch waste early.

## 2. Use Auto-Scaling and Spot Instances

For backend workloads on AWS, I switched from fixed EC2 instances to auto-scaling groups.

Even better, I replaced some with spot instances.

This alone cut my compute costs by more than 60%.

Auto-scaling ensures I only pay for what I need, when I need it.

## 3. Right-Size Everything

At first, I used default instance sizes — usually overkill for my app’s traffic.

Once I started reviewing CPU and memory metrics, I realized I could downsize instances and still maintain performance.

Smaller instances or serverless options like AWS Lambda often do the job just fine.

## 4. Move Static Assets to S3 and Use CloudFront

Initially, I served static assets (images, CSS, JS) from my app servers.

That caused unnecessary load and higher network costs.

I moved all static files to an S3 bucket and used CloudFront for CDN delivery.

This not only improved performance but significantly reduced outbound data charges.

## 5. Clean Up Unused Resources Regularly

Old dev environments, detached volumes, unused snapshots — they all cost money.

I now make it a habit to review my infrastructure every week.

A 10-minute cleanup often saves me a few dollars instantly.

Automation tools can help here too, but even manual checks go a long way.

## 6. Use Serverless When It Makes Sense

For lightweight APIs, I switched to AWS Lambda + API Gateway instead of keeping EC2s running.

It’s cheaper, scales automatically, and has no idle cost.

Just be mindful of cold starts and request limits based on your use case.

## 7. Reserve When You’re Confident

For long-term, always-on services, I started using Reserved Instances or committed use discounts.

It requires upfront commitment, but the savings (up to 70%) are worth it once your architecture is stable.

## Closing Thought

Cloud gives you flexibility — but that flexibility can turn into hidden costs if you’re not careful.

Through trial, error, and a few painful bills, I learned to treat cost as a first-class metric in every deployment.

Hopefully, these tips help you avoid the same mistakes and run your cloud apps smarter.
